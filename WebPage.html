  <h2>Main Characters:</h2>
  
  <h3>Jay Gatsby:</h3>
  <p>"If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there 
    was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises 
    of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register 
    earthquakes ten thousand miles away."</p>

   <h3>Nick Carraway:</h3>
  <p>"In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice 
    that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. "Whenever you feel like 
    criticizing any one," he told me, "just remember that all the people in 
    this world haven't had the advantages that you've had." </p>

   <h3>Daisy Buchanan:</h3>
  <p>"[She had] the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each 
    speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. . . . 
    [T]here was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found 
    difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered “Listen,” a promise 
    that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were 
    gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour."</p>

   <h3>Tom Buchanan:</h3>
  <p>"[Daisy’s] husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the 
    most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven—a national figure in a 
    way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one 
    that everything afterward savors of anticlimax."</p>

   <h3>Jordan Baker:</h3>
  <p>"Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw that this 
    was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be 
    thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest. She wasn’t able to be at a 
    disadvantage and, given this unwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in 
    subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile 
    turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard, jaunty body."</p>

   <h3>Myrtle Wilson:</h3>
  <p>"[Myrtle] was in the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her 
    surplus flesh sensuously as some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of 
    dark blue crêpe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty, but there was 
    an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were 
    continually smouldering."</p>

   <h3>George Wilson:</h3>
  <p>"Generally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn't working he 
    sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that 
    passed along the road. When any one spoke to him he invariably laughed in 
    an agreeable, colorless way. He was his wife's man and not his own."</p>
